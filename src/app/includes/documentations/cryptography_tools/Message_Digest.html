<h3>What is Message Digest and its usage?</h3>
<p>A message digest, also known as a hash function or a cryptographic hash function, is a mathematical algorithm that
    takes an input message of any length and produces a fixed-length output, known as a hash value or message digest.
    The hash value is unique to the input message and can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the
    message.

    Message digests are widely used in cryptography and computer security to ensure that data has not been tampered with
    or altered. They are used to verify the integrity of digital signatures, to store and verify passwords, to detect
    duplicate data, and to ensure the authenticity of digital certificates.

    Message digest algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are widely used in many applications to provide secure and
    reliable data storage and transmission. These algorithms generate a hash value that is unique to the input message,
    and any changes to the message will result in a different hash value. This property allows the hash value to be used
    as a digital fingerprint of the input message, which can be used to verify its integrity and authenticity.

    Message digests are an important tool for ensuring data integrity and security. They are used in many applications
    to provide a high level of security and reliability, and are an essential component of modern cryptographic systems.
