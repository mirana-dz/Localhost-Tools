<h3>What is CRC32 and its usage?</h3>
<p>CRC32 stands for "Cyclic Redundancy Check 32-bit" and is a checksum algorithm used to detect errors in data
    transmission or storage. It works by calculating a checksum value based on the data, which can be used to verify
    that the data has not been corrupted or modified.
</p>
<p>
    CRC32 is commonly used in network protocols such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and TCP/IP, as well as in storage systems such
    as hard drives and memory cards. It is also used in file formats such as ZIP and PNG to verify the integrity of the
    data.
</p>
<p>
    The CRC32 algorithm works by dividing the data into fixed-size chunks and applying a mathematical function to each
    chunk to generate a checksum value. The checksum value is then appended to the data and sent or stored along with
    it. When the data is received or read, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the original checksum value. If
    the values match, it indicates that the data has not been corrupted or modified.
</p>
<p>
    CRC32 is a simple and efficient algorithm that is widely used due to its ease of implementation and its ability to
    detect errors in data transmission or storage. However, it is not a secure algorithm and can be easily manipulated
    by an attacker. Therefore, it should not be used for security-critical applications.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, CRC32 is a checksum algorithm used to detect errors in data transmission or storage. It works by
    calculating a checksum value based on the data, which can be used to verify the integrity of the data. It is widely
    used in network protocols, storage systems, and file formats to ensure that data has not been corrupted or modified.
