<h3>What is HMAC and its usage?</h3>
<p>HMAC stands for "Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code," and is a mechanism used for verifying the authenticity and
    integrity of a message or data. It is a type of message authentication code (MAC) that uses a cryptographic hash
    function and a secret key to generate a message authentication code.
</p>
<p>
    HMAC is commonly used in network security protocols such as SSL/TLS, IPsec, and SSH. It is also used in applications
    such as digital signatures, password authentication, and message integrity checks.
</p>
<p>
    The HMAC algorithm works by taking a message, and applying a cryptographic hash function (such as SHA-256 or
    SHA-512) to it, along with a secret key. The output of the hash function is then combined with the secret key, and
    the hash function is applied again. This process is repeated until a fixed-length hash is generated, which is known
    as the HMAC.
</p>
<p>
    The secret key used in HMAC must be kept secret between the sender and receiver of the message, as it is used to
    verify the authenticity and integrity of the message. The receiver can then use the same HMAC algorithm and secret
    key to generate an HMAC for the received message, and compare it with the HMAC received with the message. If the
    HMACs match, it means that the message has not been tampered with and is authentic.
</p>
<p>
    HMAC is a widely used mechanism for providing message authentication and integrity, as it is secure, efficient, and
    relatively easy to implement. It can be used in a variety of applications where data security is important,
    including secure communications protocols, digital signatures, and password authentication.
