<h3>What is Rot13 and its usage?</h3>
<p>
    ROT13 is a simple encryption technique that is used to obscure text by rotating each letter by 13 places in the
    alphabet. For example, the letter A would be replaced by the letter N, the letter B would be replaced by the letter
    O, and so on.

    ROT13 is often used as a simple form of data obfuscation, particularly for online forums or chat rooms, where users
    might want to hide spoilers or sensitive information from others who may accidentally stumble upon it. It is also
    used in some programming languages and software applications as a simple encryption technique.

    ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, which is a simple substitution cipher that works by shifting the
    letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. However, unlike the Caesar cipher, which can be easily
    broken using frequency analysis, ROT13 is not intended to provide strong encryption, and it can be easily decrypted
    by simply applying the same ROT13 algorithm again.

<p>
    In summary, ROT13 is a simple encryption technique that rotates each letter by 13 places in the alphabet, and is
    used to obfuscate text or provide a basic level of encryption. While it is not intended to provide strong
    encryption, it can be useful for simple data obfuscation or where a small amount of encryption is needed.
