<h3>What Does URL Encoding?</h3>
<p>
    URL encoding and decoding are techniques used to convert special characters in a URL into a format that can be
    transmitted over the internet.
</p>
<p>
    URL encoding is the process of converting special characters in a URL into a percent-encoded format. For example, a
    space in a URL would be converted to "%20", a forward slash ("/") would be converted to "%2F", and so on. URL
    encoding ensures that the URL is properly formatted and can be transmitted over the internet without any issues.
</p>
<p>
    URL decoding, on the other hand, is the process of converting a percent-encoded URL back into its original form.
    This is necessary when a user clicks on a URL or submits a form that contains a percent-encoded URL.
</p>
<p>
    Both URL encoding and decoding are important for web development and internet communication. For example, web
    developers use URL encoding to pass parameters to a web page, while web browsers use URL decoding to display the
    contents of a web page. Additionally, URL encoding and decoding are used in APIs and web services to transmit data
    over the internet in a secure and efficient manner.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, URL encoding and decoding are techniques used to convert special characters in a URL into a format that
    can be transmitted over the internet, and are essential for web development and internet communication.
