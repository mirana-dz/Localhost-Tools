<h3>What is UU Encoding and its usage?</h3>
<p>
    UU encoding is a method of encoding binary data as ASCII text. It is used to transmit binary files, such as images,
    audio files, or executables, over email or other text-based channels.
</p>
<p>
    In UU encoding, each 3-byte sequence of binary data is converted into a 4-byte sequence of ASCII characters. The
    resulting encoded data is then preceded by a header that includes the name of the original file and the permissions
    that should be applied to the file when it is decoded.
</p>
<p>
    UU encoding is similar to Base64 encoding, but it is less commonly used today. One of the main advantages of UU
    encoding is that it includes a header that provides additional information about the encoded file, such as its
    original name and permissions. However, UU encoding is less efficient than Base64 encoding and can result in larger
    encoded files.
</p>
<p>
    To use UU encoding, you would need to use a UU encoder to convert the binary data into UU-encoded text and a UU
    decoder to convert the UU-encoded text back into binary data. Some email clients and file transfer tools may have
    built-in support for UU encoding and decoding, but there are also standalone tools available for encoding and
    decoding files using UU encoding.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, UU encoding is a method of encoding binary data as ASCII text and is used to transmit binary files over
    email or other text-based channels. While it is less efficient than Base64 encoding, it includes a header that
    provides additional information about the encoded file.
