<h3>What is Hex Encoding and its usage?</h3>
<p>Hex encoding, also known as hexadecimal encoding, is a method of encoding binary data as a series of hexadecimal
    digits. In this encoding scheme, each byte of binary data is converted into a two-digit hexadecimal value, ranging
    from 00 to FF.
</p>
<p>
    Hex encoding is often used in computer systems and software applications to represent binary data in a format that
    is more human-readable and easier to work with. For example, it can be used to represent the contents of a computer
    file, the memory contents of a running program, or the network traffic between two systems.
</p>
<p>
    Hex encoding is also commonly used in web development and internet communication. For example, it can be used to
    represent the contents of an HTTP message or the values of HTML form fields that contain non-ASCII characters.
</p>
<p>
    One of the advantages of hex encoding is that it is a very simple encoding scheme that can be easily implemented in
    software. It is also very efficient, as each byte of binary data is represented by only two hexadecimal digits.
</p>
<p>
    To use hex encoding, you would need to use a hex encoder to convert the binary data into hex-encoded text and a hex
    decoder to convert the hex-encoded text back into binary data. Some software applications may have built-in support
    for hex encoding and decoding, but there are also standalone tools available for encoding and decoding files using
    hex encoding.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, hex encoding is a method of encoding binary data as a series of hexadecimal digits, and is used to
    represent binary data in a format that is more human-readable and easier to work with. It is commonly used in
    computer systems, software applications, web development, and internet communication.
