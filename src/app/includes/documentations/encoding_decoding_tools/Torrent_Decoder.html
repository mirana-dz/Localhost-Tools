<h3>What is Torrent Bencode and its usage?</h3>
<p>Torrent Bencode, also known as Bencoding, is a simple binary encoding format used by BitTorrent to store and transfer
    data. It is a way to serialize data structures like dictionaries, lists, and integers into a compact binary format.
</p>
<p>
    Bencoding is used in Torrent files, which are used to distribute files over the BitTorrent network. The Torrent file
    contains metadata about the file or files being distributed, such as the file name, file size, and the location of
    the tracker server that coordinates the distribution of the file. This metadata is encoded using Bencoding.
</p>
<p>
    Bencoding is a very simple encoding format that is easy to parse and generate, making it well-suited for use in
    BitTorrent clients and other software applications that need to work with Torrent files. It is also very efficient,
    as the binary format is much smaller than the corresponding ASCII representation of the data.
</p>
<p>
    In Bencoding, each data structure is encoded in a specific way. For example, integers are represented as a string of
    digits followed by the letter 'e', lists are represented by the letter 'l' followed by their elements, and
    dictionaries are represented by the letter 'd' followed by their keys and values.
</p>
<p>
    Bencoding is a key part of the BitTorrent protocol, and is used by Torrent clients to exchange data with other peers
    on the network. When a Torrent file is downloaded, the client uses Bencoding to read the metadata and determine how
    to download the actual file or files being distributed.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, Torrent Bencode, or Bencoding, is a simple binary encoding format used by BitTorrent to store and
    transfer metadata about files being distributed over the network. It is easy to parse and generate, making it
    well-suited for use in BitTorrent clients and other software applications that need to work with Torrent files.
