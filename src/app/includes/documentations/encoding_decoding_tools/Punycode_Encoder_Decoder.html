<h3>What is Punycode and its usage?</h3>
<p>Punycode is a method used to represent Unicode characters in the ASCII character set. It is used primarily for domain
    name registration and internationalized domain names (IDNs), which allow domain names to include non-ASCII
    characters.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Domain Name System (DNS) only supports ASCII characters in domain names, Punycode is used to convert
    non-ASCII characters into ASCII-compatible format. The Punycode algorithm converts each non-ASCII character into a
    series of ASCII characters, which are then combined to form a valid domain name.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the Punycode representation of the Japanese domain name "日本語.com" is "xn--wgv71a.com". This Punycode
    representation can then be used in the DNS system to register the domain name.
</p>
<p>
    Punycode is also used in email systems and other applications that require the representation of Unicode characters
    in ASCII-compatible format. For example, Punycode is used in email addresses to represent non-ASCII characters in
    the local-part of the address.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, Punycode is a method used to represent Unicode characters in the ASCII character set, and is used
    primarily for domain name registration and internationalized domain names (IDNs). It is also used in email systems
    and other applications that require the representation of Unicode characters in ASCII-compatible format.
