<h3>What is Binary encoding and its usage?</h3>
<p>Binary encoding is a process of representing data in a binary format, which is a series of 0s and 1s. In this
    encoding scheme, each piece of data is represented by a series of bits, which can either be 0 or 1. The binary
    encoding can be used to represent a wide range of data types, including text, numbers, images, and more.

    Binary encoding is commonly used in computer systems, including file formats, network protocols, and storage
    formats. For example, binary encoding is used in the JPEG image format to represent image data in binary format, and
    it is used in the TCP/IP network protocol to encode data packets for transmission over a network.

    One of the advantages of binary encoding is that it is a very efficient encoding scheme, as each piece of data is
    represented by a series of bits, which take up very little space. Additionally, binary encoding is machine-readable,
    which means that it can be easily processed by computers and other electronic devices.
</p>
<p>
    To use binary encoding, you would need to use a binary encoder to convert the data into a binary format and a binary
    decoder to convert the binary data back into its original format. Many programming languages and software libraries
    have built-in support for binary encoding and decoding, making it easy to work with binary data in your programs.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, binary encoding is a method of encoding data in a binary format, and is commonly used in computer
    systems for file formats, network protocols, and storage formats. It is an efficient encoding scheme that is
    machine-readable and can be easily processed by computers and other electronic devices.
